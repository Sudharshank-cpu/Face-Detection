## Features:
- Detects faces in images and video streams.<br>
- Uses Haarcascade classifiers for face detection.<br>
- Easy to integrate with other applications.<br>

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository<br>
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sudharshank-cpu/Face-Detection.git
    ```

    ```bash
    cd Face-Detection
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies<br>
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage:
1. Run the face detection python script<br>
