Face Detection that I made is a Python-based project that uses Haarcascade classifiers to detect faces in images or video streams. This project is useful for applications such as security systems, photo tagging, and more.

## Features:
- Detects faces in images and video streams.
- Uses Haarcascade classifiers for face detection.
- Easy to integrate with other applications.
